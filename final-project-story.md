Having desserts with friends at Shattuck Avenue, wandering around the shops and mural arts at Telegraph Avenue, or enjoying a lazy afternoon under the sun sitting on a bench in the downtown district, there are many ways to have fun in Berkeley City. As the pandemic eases, more commercial activities are seen in hustle-bustle neighborhoods. <br/>

A [report](https://berkeleyca.gov/doing-business/economic-development/economic-dashboards-and-reports) by the City of Berkeley Office of Economic Development shows a slightly increased in the Retail and Food & Beverage industries, which raised the city’s sales tax revenue. The recovery of economic activity is also shown in Personal Services, such as automotive Repair or Salons. <br/>

But what exactly is the composition of business look like in the city of Berkeley? <br/>

To find out, we pulled out the business licenses dataset of Berkeley city (dataset based on April 26, 2022). Among all 12,760 businesses registered, “Rental of Real Property” has the highest 25.80% of all business types, followed by “Construction or Contractor” with 22.81% and “Professional SemiProfessional” with 21.41%.

Then, by separating the factor of indicating female or non-female owned businesses, the result comes slightly different. Among all 2,382 female-owned businesses, "Rental of Real Property" is the largest business type (41.73%), followed by "Professional SemiProfessional"(25.73%), "Retail Trade"(9.87%), and "Business Personal Repair Svs"(9.19%). However, for other 10,378 non-female-owned businesses, "Construction or contractor" is the largest business type(27.06%), followed by "Rental of Real Property"(22.14%) and "Professional SemiProfessional"(20.42%).

### Women-owned business in Rental of Real Property

“I prefer looking for female-identifying landlords,” said Alice Dong, a graduate student at UC Berkeley. Like Dong, many students at UC Berkeley are seeking housing around the campus. As  UC Berkeley announced in-person courses starting in Fall 2021, students and staff who once attended class remotely returned to Berkeley City. There are 1,239 new tenancies entering the Berkeley City housing market, according to the market meidan report of the [Rent Stabilization Board](https://rentboard.berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/2022-01/Market%20Medians_2021_Q3.pdf) released in January 2022. <br/>

According to the US Census Bureau, the city has 57.1% of rental homes and 42.9% of owned homes, that is, more than half of the housing properties in Berkeley city are for rental purposes. The owner-occupied housing unit rate is lower than the national average (64.1%) and the average in California state (54.8%). The rate of Berkeley City did not change significantly from 2013 to 2019. <br/>

### Business Composition around UC Berkeley Campus

The high demands for housing around UC Berkeley also reflect the number of business licenses in “Rental of Real Property” around the campus. To take a closer look at the business composition of areas around the UC Berkeley campus, we identified the zip codes “94704” and “94709” that have covered all the areas around the school, including the “North Shattuck”, "Downtown", and "Telegraph Avenue District" neighborhoods, where most commercial activities around the school take place. <br/>

Among all businesses around the area of the UC Berkeley campus, “Rental of Real Property” has the highest proportion of business licenses, a total of 42.13%, followed by “Professional SemiProfessional”, with a total of 22.13%, “Retail Trade”, with a total of 16.36%, and “Non-Profit Organizations”, with a total 8.71%. Putting the factor of indicating female-owned business type doesn’t affect the result. According to a [report](https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/Commercial%20District%20Dashboard%202021.pdf) from the City of Berkeley Office of Economic Development, even though the net sales tax revenue has slightly gone up, the areas around the UC Berkeley campus are still experiencing a downward. And the vacancy of the properties in both “Downtown” and “Telegraph Avenue” is higher than the Citywide average. <br/>

However, we cannot tell by the dataset whether female-owned businesses are growing due to the limitation of the dataset. The US Census Bureau 2018 Annual Business Survey shows that the number of women-owned employer firms raised and the Berkeley Chamber has launched the “Women Entrepreneurs of Berkeley (WEB)” program that helps connect innovative women in Berkeley.
